// This is a simple script that shows a message
alert("Hello, world!");

// What happens:
// 1. You load this in a webpage.
// 2. The JavaScript engine reads this line with an interpreter.
// 3. It translates "alert" into machine code to show a popup.
// 4. Since this runs only once, the engine doesn’t bother compiling it—it’s fast enough!
